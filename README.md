## Development Process
The creation of this dashboard involved thoughtful decisions and best practices to ensure a high-quality, insightful tool for analysis. Below are some key points about the development process:

- **Fictional Data**: All data used in this project is fictional, ensuring there are no concerns regarding confidentiality or proprietary information.
- **Excel File Consistency**: To maintain consistency and avoid the need for frequent updates, we chose not to manipulate the original Excel files. Instead, all necessary transformations were performed in Power Query.
- **Optimized Data Model**: Modifications in Power Query focused on eliminating unnecessary columns, streamlining the dataset, and improving performance.
- **Preference for Measures**:Instead of creating calculated columns, we prioritized DAX measures to handle formulas. This approach reduced the computational load on Power BI and ensured better performance.
- **Relevant Insights**: Every formula and visual was built with the end user in mind. We consistently asked, ‚ÄúWhat information is most relevant and meaningful to a business owner, CEO, or decision-maker?‚Äù This mindset drove the design of KPIs and interactivity.
- **Dynamic and Adaptive**: The dashboard was structured to adapt to varying business needs through dynamic filters, tooltips, and interactive visuals.
